# üí´ About Me:
üî≠<br>Over the past nine months, I've delved into the world of programming, focusing on mastering the Python language. At the age of 16, I developed a keen interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and dedicated my time to understanding their intricacies. I took on the challenge of programming these UAVs, experimenting with control algorithms, and overcoming hurdles in the process.<br><br>In parallel, I enrolled in DevOps courses, recognizing the importance of automation, configuration management, and continuous development and deployment practices. Despite my young age, I found immense satisfaction in acquiring skills crucial to crafting efficient and innovative technological solutions.<br><br>This journey has not only shaped my technical competence but also fueled my passion for exploring the intersection of programming, UAVs, and DevOps methodologies. Looking forward, I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in the dynamic world of IT
